## Hi there!

Hi, my name is Yomna Elmousalami!

I am a computer science undergraduate student at Old Dominion University, part of the Honors College. Throughout my college experience, I have made sure to learn many new skills and network with professionals. 

So far, I have the most experience in C++, Java, Python, MySQL, and PHP programming, but, am still well-versed in many other programming languages. Additionally, my main areas of interest are in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. However, I am still open to exploring the many fields and niches that computer science has to offer. 

In May 2023, I began working as an undergraduate research assisant, with a computer science professor at Old Dominion University. My first project was to aid students in a juvenile detention center gain access to a high quality computer science education. During this project, I conducted a qualitative analysis on a focus group interview and found that vocational training was a high-need area for detained students. I learned how to program in PHP to create an interactive and engaing personal learning environment. After, I presented and published an abstract and presentation at the Old Dominion Univeristy Undergraduate Research Symposium in the Spring of 2024. To this day, I am still working in undergraduate research to further my educational career and gain a Masters degree in computer science.

In addition to undergraduate research, I am a current participant in the Cornell Univeristy Break Through Tech AI fellowship. In this fellowship, I am learning how to train, test, and evaluate machine learning models on real-world datasets. Additionally, I am working with industry professionals at the LegalDuel company to develop a bot that can compete in a legal duel and determine the best answer to a customer, by using Python, large language models, and natural language processing. In the future, I hope to use these skills to gain an internship and network with experienced computer science professionals.

While I complete my academic studies, I still remain eager to engage in any computer science related internships, apprenticeships, or opportunities. I am excited to see what is in store for the future.

For now, here is a link to access all of the technical projects that I have completed during my B.S. in CS:
